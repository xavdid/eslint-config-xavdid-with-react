# eslint-config-xavdid-with-react

Lint your code just like I do.

## Explanation

This was spun off of my main config, [eslint-config-xavdid](https://github.com/xavdid/eslint-config-xavdid). This repo has extra React.js rules.

The [the other package](https://github.com/xavdid/eslint-config-xavdid) for more docs.

## Installation

```
yarn add --dev eslint-config-xavdid-with-react
```

You'll also need to make sure `typescript` and `eslint` are available.
